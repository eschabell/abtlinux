To run the unit tests you will need to make use of the flexmock gem, to
install this run:

gem install flexmock

I am trying to use this to mock up package objects to prevent downloading,
actual configure, build and install runs while providing unit testing for
these methods.

For information on usage and such, see http://onestepback.org/software/flexmock/
