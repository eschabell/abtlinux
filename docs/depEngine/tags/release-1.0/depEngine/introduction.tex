\section{Introduction}
The workings of a software package management system (SPMS) are very complicated. It is a tool to automate the process of managing a systems software packages. These kinds of tools are most commonly used on Unix-like systems, in particular Linux. Such systems rely heavily on their SPMS which manage large amounts of software packages. A typical installation includes hundreds of packages, not an uncommon occurrence on modern day systems. Packages can have dependencies on other packages. It is essential to have some method to handle these dependencies systematically in a SPMS. This is the goal of this dependency engine project, to define the necessary requirements to handle the dependencies for the ABout Time Linux (AbTLinux) distributions SPMS. AbTLinux stands for ABout Time Linux and it focuses on delivering a source-based Linux distribution.
