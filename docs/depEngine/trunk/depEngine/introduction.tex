\section{Introduction}
The workings of a software package management system (SPMS) is very complicated. Itï¿½is a tool to automate the process of managing a systems software packages. These kinds of tools are most commonly used on Unix-like systems, in particular Linux. Such systems rely heavily on their package management system which manage large amounts of software packages. A typical installation includes hundreds of packages, not an uncommon occurrence on modern day systems. Packages can have dependencies on other packages. It is essential to have some method to handle these dependencies systematically in a package manager. This is the goal of this dependency engine project, to define the necessary requirements to handle the dependencies for the ABout Time Linux (AbTLinux) distributions software package manager. AbTLinux stands for ABout Time Linux and it focuses on delivering a source-based Linux distribution.

Clear documentation is one of the main goals behind the development on the AbTLinux project. As the projects website states, "Clearly documented design, clear development goals leading to each release and just getting them done. Most members of the AbTLinux project have worked on other Linux distribution projects and have grown tired of working on badly documented designs." \cite{schabell2005abtlinux} This requirements document teams goals consists of continuing this structured and clear way of gathering information for the dependency engine part of the AbTLinux project.
