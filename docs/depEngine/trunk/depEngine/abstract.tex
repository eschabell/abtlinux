\begin{abstract}
This document describes the requirements for the ABout Time Linux dependency engine, a component of the AbTLinux package manager. These requirements were obtained by a student project group that participated in the Radboud University Nijmegen course called Requirements Engineering. This document represents the best results obtained from the six participating groups. The basis of the project flows from the main AbTLinux project goals. "Clearly documented design, clear development goals leading to each release and just getting them done. Most members of the AbTLinux project have worked on other Linux distribution projects and have grown tired of working on badly documented designs." \cite{schabell2005abtlinux} This requirements documents goal is to provide a structured and clear way of gathering information for the dependency engine project.
