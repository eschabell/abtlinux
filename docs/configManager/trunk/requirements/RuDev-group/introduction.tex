\section{Introduction}



AbTLinux is a source-based Linux distribution for which new functionality is continuously being released. 
Mostly this includes improvements or add-ons. Functionality is released in the form of packages, which can be downloaded, configured and installed.

For most of the AbTLinux Community some of the most annoying problems are the configuration problems. Some of these problems are for example that the user is unable to find the configuration or 
that the installation process completely overwrites the current configuration of the user. Therefore the AbTLinux Community has asked a group of Radboud University Students to develop
the requirements for a component that will solve these problems. In this paper we will present our findings.
