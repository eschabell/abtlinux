\section{Mission, Vision and Values}

\subsection{Mission}

The AbTLinux community is trying to build up a source-based Linux distribution based on a tool set that is well documented. After designing a well documented dependency engine, the community now wants to get rid of configuration trouble. In most of the current Linux distributions the configuration can give the user a lot of trouble. The biggest problems which need to be solved are the overwriting of your existing configuration files, after install not knowing where to find the configuration files and not be able to merge older and newer configuration files.

\subsection{Vision}

The aim of this configManager project is to develop a well documented configManager for the AbTLinux community which will solve the problems as mentioned at the Problem statement (Chapter 2).

\subsection{Values}

The AbTLinux community has as main value:
\begin{quote}
With clear goals, clear documentation and clear coding practices everyone from users on down to developers can benefit from our project.
\end{quote}
We will try to accomplish this value by designing well documented requirements for the configManager Project.
