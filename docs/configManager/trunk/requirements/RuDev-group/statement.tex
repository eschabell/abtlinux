\section{Statement of Work}

\subsection{Project Scope}

This project is committed to delivering the requirements documentation for a configManager for the AbTLinux project. The documentation should be understandable for all relevant stakeholders and is to be used by the developers. Therefore it is agreed upon that the documentation includes a description of the system presented as a complete set of use cases and use case diagram. 
The configManager should be able to manage configurations of packages in a user-friendly manner. AbTLinux and it’s users will depend on the configManager for the configuration of packages when it is running. 
The development of the configManager is outside the scope of this project.

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The project team will deliver the requirements documentation for a configManager for AbTLinux.
	\item The documentation will describe the system requirements with use cases.
	\item The requirements documentation forms the basis for the development of the system.
	\item The documentation should include all relevant system requirements and thus be formed in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Application overview}

The configManager is part of the distribution AbTLinux. It must be able to provide a mechanism for management of options such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Install new configuration
	\item Manage upgrade of configuration
	\item Merge two configurations
	\item Ensure never losing an existing configuration
	\item Backing up configurations
	\item Edit configurations
	\item Find configurations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User demography}

\textbf{Developers}\newline
The developers need a clear description of the system requirements.
\newline\newline
\textbf{AbTLinux}\newline
The AbTLinux system will depend on the configManager for the management of configurations for packages in AbTLinux.
\newline\newline
\textbf{End-users}\newline
The end-users will depend on the configManager for the management of configurations for packages in AbTLinux. When participating as stakeholder in the project they will have to be able to understand the system requirements as documented. 


\subsection{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system requirements need to be described with use cases and use case diagrams.
	\item The requirements documentation must be completed before 8th of December 2006.
	\item The groupmembers wil each be available for 6 ects during this project.
	\item The use of the English language because the developers come from different countries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

The project team relies on input from all relevant stakeholders. We expect to be able to meet with the executive sponsors (Eric Schabell) and his assistant (Ilona Wilmont) for their input and feedback. 
Also we expect to be supported in the documentation process by Stijn Hoppenbrouwers with issues related to requirements engineering.
The Configuration Management use cases are related to the AbTLinux use cases and partially dependant on them. We expect these use cases to be complete and correct.

\subsection{Staffing and cost}

The project will be performed by:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Email} & \textbf{StudentNr} & \textbf{Availability}  \\
		\hline Sander Bosman & sbosman@gmail.com & 0534323 & 6 ects  \\
		\hline Maikel Couwenberg & maikelc@gmx.net & 0427551 & 6 ects  \\
		\hline Nordine Omari & n.omari@student.ru.nl & ? & 6 ects \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Project costs include time effort in work by the project team.

Expected duration

The project has the following fixed deadlines:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase I (Facade): Thursday 26th of October, 9.00 hrs.\\
		 In the Facade phase the requirements are outlined in use cases without much details.
	\item Phase II-a (Filled): Friday 24th of November, 18.00 hrs.
	\item Phase II (Filled and Focused): Thursday 8th of December, 9.00 hrs. \\
		 In the Filled phase the use cases are extended and filled. \\
		 At the Focused phase essential use cases are separated from the nice-to-have and completed.
\end{itemize}

All required documentation will be expected one week in advance of the deadline among the project team.
