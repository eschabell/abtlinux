\section{Introduction}  
The \emph{ABout Time Linux (AbTLinux)} package managers design will be dealt with in
this document. I will cover them in the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
  \item details of \emph{AbTLinux} design, worked out in \emph{UML} diagrams.
\end{itemize}

The driving force behind this project is to design a basic software package management system that will provide the needed infrastructure to not only install software packages, but also be able to maintain the systems it is installing the software packages onto. I believe this can be done using source based packages and by avoiding the existing RPM and DEB package management systems. This is not new, nor do I pretend to have found the Holy Grail of package management tools. The primary goal is a well documented design, with clearly documented coding practices which will result in an easily maintainable package manager. This in turn will be the foundation of this Linux distribution. Make no mistake about it, the clarity of design and coding practices will take the foremost priority in this project.

I will present my ideas in the following section with a design for the package management system, which will include implementation choices such as the language and system requirements. This design is based on earlier work in \cite{2006-Schabell-LinuxRequirements}.
