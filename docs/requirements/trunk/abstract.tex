\begin{abstract}
This document will detail a project that has risen from the desire to create
a generic framework for managing the software on a Linux system. It is based
on my experiences while working as a developer on a source-based Linux distribution
spanning more than three years at the time of this writing.

I hope to take my experiences as a developer and package maintainer to create
this new package manager. I follow in the footsteps of a few pretty good
existing projects such as \cite{micropkg04site}, \cite{easinstaller04site} and
\cite{smgl04site}, though I have found these to be lacking in some way or another.
