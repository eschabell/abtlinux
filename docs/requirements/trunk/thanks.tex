\section{Thanks}
This is to thank those whose input and critical eyes have been on this
document since the early days of its conception. I will list them in
alphabetical order:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bas van Gils for his proof reading and insistent nature that keeps me busy.
\item Benoit Papillault for his freely given time and support with all projects we have worked on together.
\item Jose Silva, another critical eye and stable spirit in the often turbulent world of free software development.
\item Tony Smith who has been my verbal Linux sparring partner for a long time.
\item Laurent Wandrebeck who is a pretty sharp DB cookie and long time partner in Linux crimes.
\end{itemize}

Thanks guys!

\emph{Special mention:} the Source Mage GNU/Linux team - For good or bad my experiences with you 
taught me much, for that I am forever greatfull. You are always welcome in my world!
