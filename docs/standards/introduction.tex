\section{Introduction}  
The \emph{ABout Time Linux (AbTLinux)} coding standards will attempt to layout
a basic set of guidelines concerning how we layout our code in this project.
Note the use of \emph{guidelines} and not rules. These guidelines are meant to
be the spirit of our coding, adhered to as much as possible, deviated from
when common sense dictates that the results would be clearer.

Read on and discover how we hope to present easily readable code above smart
or deviously clever coding. For any additions to or comments about this
