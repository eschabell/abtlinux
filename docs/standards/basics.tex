\section{The basics}  
We will attempt to layout our basic guidelines without any particular order,
therefore it will become a necessity that the document be read in its entirety
to cover all the presented guidelines.


\subsection{Control structures}
Where possible, no syntax shortcuts will be taken when presenting looping control
structures. Preferences will be for clarity in expanded syntax such as:

\begin{verbatim}
	if radiation > 3000
	  puts ``Danger, too high!''
	end
\end{verbatim}
	
Above any kind of shortening of the syntax like:

\begin{verbatim}
	puts ``Danger, too high!'' if radiation > 3000
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Regular expressions}
While regular expressions are a very powerful tool, the often remain very
cryptic and hard to decipher for anyone except the developer that wrote it. To
create a coding environment that makes it easy to get started we will require
that all regular expressions be commented with a short description of what
that particular expression is doing (or attempting to do!) such as:

\begin{verbatim}
	# This expression is matching for 'Ruby', a space and either 'Perl' or
	# 'Python'.
	#
	if line =~ /Ruby (Perl|Python)/
    puts ``Some text.''
	end
\end{verbatim}
